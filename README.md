# IBM Data Science Capstone Project
The final project required for completion of the IBM Data Science course. The aim of the project is to predict whether a SpaceX launch will land their boosters successfully. This prediction enables a competing company to predict the cost of a SpaceX launch, and allow a competitor to offer a launch to customers at a cheaper price.
